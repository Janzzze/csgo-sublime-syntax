CSGO SUBLIME SYNTAX
=================

very basic syntax highlighting for CSGO config files

## NOT UP TO DATE

- locked developer and experimental cvars
- MIRV (AdvancedFX) cvars for moviemaking
- aliases for weapons used by "buy" and "autobuy" commands

## known issues

- not up to date, recent vars (HLAE and CSGO) are not implemented and thus does not look right


based on TF2 syntax [Config.tmLanguage](https://github.com/denolfe/Config.tmLanguage/) by denolfe
